## For working on the course table
* The student will need to install papaparse package (*npm install papaparse*).
* This table is dinamically created depending on csv file entries.

## For working on the Student Page
* The student page file is *studentPage.js* (src/pages/studentPage.js).
* The student page file for style is *studentPage.css* (src/styles/pages/studentPage.css).

## For working with the Dummy Data Maker Interface
* Run `node DataMakerServer.js` from *src/dummydata* (use `cd src/dummydata`)
  and leave it running in a separate terminal while using Dummy Data Maker.
